# Feature Plans

Canonical storage for `plan feature <id>` outputs.

## Scope ownership

- This file stores plan artifacts only.
- Command semantics/order are defined in `dev/TASK_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`.
- Planning quality requirements are defined in `dev/FEATURE_PLANNING_PROTOCOL.md`.

## Format

Each feature plan section must use the feature ID as a heading and include:
- Dependencies
- Decomposition
- Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment

Canonical per-issue plan block format inside a feature section:
- Heading: `### <issue_id> - <issue_title>` (one block per issue ID).
- Allowed inner headings: only `#### Dependencies`, `#### Decomposition`, `#### Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment`.
- All three inner headings are mandatory for each issue block.

## Planned Features

<!-- Add or update feature plan sections below, for example: -->
<!-- ## F<local>-M<milestone> -->
<!-- ### Dependencies -->
<!-- ... -->

## F4-M1

### Issue Execution Order
1. `I7-F4-M1` - Issue creation command for feature/standalone with optional plan init
2. `I9-F4-M1` - Add workflow CLI show/status commands for feature/issue/task
3. `I13-F4-M1` - Auto-delete sync delta file after successful decomposition write
### Dependencies
- See issue-level dependency blocks below.

### Decomposition
1. Execute follow-up issues in `Issue Execution Order`.
2. Keep per-issue implementation details inside canonical issue-plan blocks.

### Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment
- Decomposition is maintained per issue block; no extra feature-level split is required.
