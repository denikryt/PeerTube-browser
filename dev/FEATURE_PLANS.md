# Feature Plans

Canonical storage for `plan feature <id>` outputs.

## Scope ownership

- This file stores plan artifacts only.
- Command semantics/order are defined in `dev/TASK_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`.
- Planning quality requirements are defined in `dev/FEATURE_PLANNING_PROTOCOL.md`.

## Format

Each feature plan section must use the feature ID as a heading and include:
- Dependencies
- Decomposition
- Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment

Canonical per-issue plan block format inside a feature section:
- Heading: `### <issue_id> - <issue_title>` (one block per issue ID).
- Allowed inner headings: only `#### Dependencies`, `#### Decomposition`, `#### Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment`.
- All three inner headings are mandatory for each issue block.

## Planned Features

<!-- Add or update feature plan sections below, for example: -->
<!-- ## F<local>-M<milestone> -->
<!-- ### Dependencies -->
<!-- ... -->

## F4-M1

### Issue Execution Order
1. `I7-F4-M1` - Issue creation command for feature/standalone with optional plan init
2. `I9-F4-M1` - Add workflow CLI show/status commands for feature/issue/task
3. `I13-F4-M1` - Auto-delete sync delta file after successful decomposition write
4. `I32-F4-M1` - Allow materialize for Pending issues without mandatory issue plan/tasks
5. `I33-F4-M1` - Split DEV_MAP schema ownership into JSON schema and rules doc only
6. `I34-F4-M1` - Enforce explicit task breakdown quality in Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment
### Dependencies
- See issue-level dependency blocks below.

### Decomposition
1. Execute follow-up issues in `Issue Execution Order`.
2. Keep per-issue implementation details inside canonical issue-plan blocks.

### Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment
- Decomposition is maintained per issue block; no extra feature-level split is required.

### I32-F4-M1 - Allow materialize for Pending issues without mandatory issue plan/tasks

#### Dependencies
- `dev/workflow_lib/feature_commands.py` materialize status gate (`_enforce_materialize_issue_status_gate`) and related error contract.
- Runtime `execute issue` command path and its issue-status validation point.
- Canonical command/protocol owners: `dev/TASK_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md` and policy owner `AGENTS.md`.
- Secondary index/planning docs that must mirror canonical rules without drift: `dev/FEATURE_WORKFLOW.md`, `dev/FEATURE_PLANNING_PROTOCOL.md`.
- Regression harness for workflow behavior: `tests/check-workflow-cli-smoke.sh`.

#### Decomposition
1. Update policy text in `AGENTS.md` to remove the obsolete `explicit plan approval` dependency and allow `materialize feature` for `Pending` issue nodes before `plan issue`/`plan tasks`.
2. Update canonical command contract in `dev/TASK_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`:
   - keep `plan tasks` gate for `Pending` as-is,
   - relax `materialize feature --mode issues-create|issues-sync` gate for unmapped issues from `Tasked` to active planning states (`Pending`/`Planned`/`Tasked`),
   - keep terminal-status protection (`Done`/`Rejected`) for create-oriented materialize behavior.
3. Align reference docs with canonical contract changes:
   - `dev/FEATURE_WORKFLOW.md` materialize gate wording,
   - `dev/FEATURE_PLANNING_PROTOCOL.md` Gate C checklist.
4. Add strict execution gate for issue-chain execution:
   - `execute issue <issue_id>` is allowed only when both conditions are true at the same time:
     - target issue status is exactly `Tasked`,
     - remote mapping is present and valid: `gh_issue_number` is non-null and `gh_issue_url` is non-empty.
   - if at least one condition is not met, execution must fail with deterministic gate error output and no execution side effects.
   - gate error must explicitly report which condition failed (status gate, mapping gate, or both).
5. Update runtime behavior in `dev/workflow_lib/feature_commands.py`:
   - adjust `_enforce_materialize_issue_status_gate` to match new allowed statuses,
   - keep mapped-issue `issues-sync` exception behavior,
   - replace stale guidance in error text (`run plan tasks ... first`) with gate-specific actionable output.
6. Update smoke coverage in `tests/check-workflow-cli-smoke.sh`:
   - add/adjust fixture where unmapped `Pending` issue succeeds in `feature materialize --mode issues-create`,
   - add execute-issue gate checks that reject `Pending`/`Planned` and allow `Tasked`,
   - ensure no failure expectation remains that requires `Tasked` for materialization of new issues,
   - keep decomposition (`plan tasks`) gate tests for `Pending` unchanged.
7. Run targeted workflow smoke and protocol consistency checks; if any gate mismatch remains, reconcile docs/code/tests in the same change set.

#### Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment
- Scope is intentionally minimal and localized to gate contracts for materialize + execute-issue readiness.
- The change set naturally splits into four implementation tasks:
  1. policy+protocol alignment,
  2. execute-issue status gate update,
  3. materialize gate update,
  4. smoke-test adjustments + final consistency validation.
- No new trackers or process artifacts are required; existing workflow docs/tests are sufficient for acceptance.

### I33-F4-M1 - Split DEV_MAP schema ownership into JSON schema and rules doc only

#### Dependencies
- Existing tracker schema style references: `dev/map/TASK_LIST_JSON_SCHEMA.json`, `dev/map/TASK_EXECUTION_PIPELINE_JSON_SCHEMA.json`.
- Current canonical owner links to migrate: `AGENTS.md`, `dev/TASK_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`, `dev/FEATURE_PLANNING_PROTOCOL.md`.
- DEV_MAP write/read command paths that must remain stable after schema-owner switch.
- Workflow validation and smoke checks (`python3 dev/workflow validate ...`, `tests/check-workflow-cli-smoke.sh`).

#### Decomposition
1. Create `dev/map/DEV_MAP_JSON_SCHEMA.json` as the only structural contract for `dev/map/DEV_MAP.json`:
   - include object hierarchy (`milestones -> features/issues/tasks`, `standalone_issues`, metadata fields),
   - enforce status enums, required fields, ID patterns, and strict `additionalProperties` behavior where appropriate,
   - align schema version contract with current `DEV_MAP.json` (`schema_version`).
2. Create `dev/map/DEV_MAP_RULES.md` as the only semantic/process contract:
   - define lifecycle/gates/transitions and command-level interpretation rules,
   - define ownership map for what belongs to rules vs JSON schema,
   - explicitly prohibit duplicating structural field/type constraints from JSON schema.
3. Remove legacy owner `dev/map/DEV_MAP_SCHEMA.md` from the contract:
   - rewrite all repository dependencies to the two new canonical files,
   - update references in `AGENTS.md`, `dev/TASK_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`, `dev/FEATURE_PLANNING_PROTOCOL.md`, and other process/docs files,
   - do not keep compatibility aliases, redirects, or duplicate fallback docs.
4. Wire strict machine validation into workflow path(s) that mutate DEV_MAP:
   - validate resulting `DEV_MAP.json` against `DEV_MAP_JSON_SCHEMA.json` before/after write operations,
   - fail deterministically with actionable schema error output on violations.
5. Add regression checks for ownership split and dependency rewrite:
   - validate that no canonical doc still points to `DEV_MAP_SCHEMA.md`,
   - validate that both new files are present and used by validation flow,
   - cover at least one negative schema case to confirm hard failure behavior.
6. Run full consistency pass:
   - workflow smoke (`tests/check-workflow-cli-smoke.sh`),
   - feature plan lint for affected feature section,
   - targeted grep audit to ensure no residual canonical references to removed owner.

#### Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment
- Scope is migration-oriented and intentionally breaks backward compatibility by design.
- Work is separated into structural contract, semantic rules, dependency rewrite, and validation enforcement to keep responsibilities non-overlapping.
- Expected outcome is deterministic: two canonical files only (`DEV_MAP_JSON_SCHEMA.json`, `DEV_MAP_RULES.md`) with zero canonical dependency on `DEV_MAP_SCHEMA.md`.

### I34-F4-M1 - Enforce explicit task breakdown quality in Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment

#### Dependencies
- Planning quality owner: `dev/FEATURE_PLANNING_PROTOCOL.md`.
- Command/lint implementation path: `dev/workflow_lib/feature_commands.py` (`plan-issue` write/lint flow).
- Canonical command-order owner references: `dev/TASK_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`, `dev/FEATURE_WORKFLOW.md`.
- Regression harness for quality gates: `tests/check-workflow-cli-smoke.sh`.

#### Decomposition
1. Define strict quality contract for `Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment` in `dev/FEATURE_PLANNING_PROTOCOL.md`:
   - section must contain a numbered task breakdown list (not generic prose),
   - each task item must include implementation target, concrete file/module scope, and validation step,
   - reject vague placeholders (`improve`, `refine`, `etc.` without implementation/validation details).
2. Update canonical references in process docs so this rule is declared once in planning owner and referenced elsewhere:
   - `dev/TASK_EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md` and `dev/FEATURE_WORKFLOW.md` should reference planning owner without duplicating rule text.
3. Implement enforcement in workflow lint path (`dev/workflow_lib/feature_commands.py`):
   - parse the `Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment` section and require explicit numbered task rows,
   - return deterministic error messages indicating missing task list or incomplete task item fields.
4. Update `feature plan-issue` generation behavior:
   - produced block must include issue-specific task breakdown (not fallback boilerplate),
   - generated tasks must map directly to the issue context (`title`, `description`, affected modules).
5. Align existing active issue plan blocks in `dev/FEATURE_PLANS.md` to the new contract where required.
6. Add smoke coverage for pass/fail cases:
   - fail when assessment contains only abstract text,
   - pass when assessment has explicit task list with implementation + validation details.
7. Run full lint/smoke verification and fix any residual drift in one change set.

#### Issue/Task Decomposition Assessment
1. Task A: Planning contract hardening
   - Deliverable: explicit normative rule text in `dev/FEATURE_PLANNING_PROTOCOL.md`.
   - Validation: `feature plan-lint` rejects issue blocks that miss numbered task breakdown.
2. Task B: Lint parser enforcement
   - Deliverable: parser/validator updates in `dev/workflow_lib/feature_commands.py` for assessment task rows.
   - Validation: deterministic error output identifies exact missing element per task row.
3. Task C: Plan-issue output quality
   - Deliverable: `feature plan-issue` writes issue-specific task list with concrete implementation scope.
   - Validation: generated block includes actionable tasks tied to issue context, no generic stubs.
4. Task D: Existing-plan conformance update
   - Deliverable: normalize affected active issue blocks in `dev/FEATURE_PLANS.md` to new format.
   - Validation: `python3 dev/workflow feature plan-lint --id F4-M1` returns `valid: true`.
5. Task E: Regression coverage
   - Deliverable: smoke cases for failing/good assessment content in `tests/check-workflow-cli-smoke.sh`.
   - Validation: smoke run fails on vague assessment and passes on explicit task breakdown format.
